# command_and_control_server
In this project, I built a component of a Command and Control (C2C) server that allows agents in a multi-agent system to become aware of each other. The C2C server is able to maintain a list of active agents and respond to various actions as issued by the agents. The server will run on a port (supplied by a command line argument) and will respond to TCP connections from agents. Agents send various actions to the server to update the information maintained. Actions include JOIN, LEAVE, LIST (responds with list of agents that have joined but not already left) and LOG(The C2C maintains record of any information about any connection along with a time stamp and the response sent).
